# Stage 6 — Next-Layer Capability (Signal-driven) (Planned + Guardrails Set)

## Success Criteria
- Roadmap additions are triggered by observed usage pain, not speculation.
- New work preserves canonical-input + computed-projection architecture.

## Risks
- Premature complexity (multi-budget depth, reconciliation/import) before usage signal.
- Contract drift away from PillID-first APIs.

## Trigger Policy
Advance Stage 6 features only when one or more are true:
1. Repeated user-reported pain in transaction/category workflows.
2. Measured drop-off in current MVP loop completion.
3. Explicit operational need (e.g., reconciliation/import burden).

## Candidate Backlog (deferred)
- richer month budgeting semantics
- assignment/move audit UX
- reconciliation/import workflows
- passkey auth polish
- multi-budget graduation

## Outcome
Stage 6 is intentionally not feature-complete by design; governance and guardrails are now documented so expansion remains signal-driven and architecture-safe.
